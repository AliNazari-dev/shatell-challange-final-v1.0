# shatell challange

I developed this project with multiple technologies and tried to treat it like a real project:

next.js V13.4 ( v14 has a problem react-testing library)
TypeScript
tailwind css
shadcn ( for developing component , I know it may seem like cheating or over engineering But my goal was to show a new soloution for design  )
I tried to design Reusable component like ( linkedButton )
I used Schema with Zod for validation form of Login page and The developer can add more validation conditions to it in future
I used Nextjs Server-actions for login and register form

//

- [ ] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [ ] See proper message if entered email is not valid in the Login page
- [ ] See the entered comment in the first place of comments on the Landing page
- [ ] See Profile link {username} instead of Sign in and Sign up on the Landing page after successful login

# What did I do? from top of the page

- I developed layout Page for Desktop and mobile
- I used hamberger-menu Svg for mobile device When you click on it, you will see the link
- I tried to have an animation for the banner and Slider with react-slick for Slider comment
- Unfortunately, due to work problems, I could not write a more professional test for the project, so I settled for a small test

I will try on the second day of the challenge to add See Profile link {username} instead of Sign in and Sign up on the Landing page after successful login
